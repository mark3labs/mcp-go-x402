# X402 MCP Transport Refactor - Complete

This branch implements the official x402 MCP transport specification, moving payment handling from HTTP headers to JSON-RPC `_meta` fields.

## Changes Made

### Client Transport (transport.go)
- ✅ Modified `SendRequest()` to handle JSON-RPC 402 errors instead of HTTP 402 status
- ✅ Created `handlePaymentRequiredJSONRPC()` for JSON-RPC payment flow
- ✅ Added `injectPaymentIntoRequest()` to inject payment into `params._meta["x402/payment"]`
- ✅ Added `extractAndRecordSettlement()` to extract settlement from `result._meta["x402/payment-response"]`
- ✅ Removed old HTTP-based payment handling

### Server Middleware (server/middleware.go)
- ✅ Created payment middleware for MCP layer payment verification
- ✅ Checks for payment in `params._meta["x402/payment"]`
- ✅ Returns JSON-RPC error with code 402 when payment is missing
- ✅ Verifies and settles payments using facilitator
- ✅ Injects settlement response into `result._meta["x402/payment-response"]`

### Server Refactoring (server/server.go)
- ✅ Updated to use middleware instead of HTTP handler wrapper
- ✅ Simplified server structure (removed HTTP interception layer)
- ✅ Handler now returns standard MCP HTTP server

### Tests
- ✅ Updated all transport tests for JSON-RPC 402 flow
- ✅ Created middleware_test.go with comprehensive middleware tests
- ✅ All existing server tests still pass
- ✅ All 36 tests passing

## Protocol Changes

### Payment Required Signaling
**Before:** HTTP 402 status with payment requirements in body  
**After:** JSON-RPC error with code 402 and requirements in error.data

### Payment Transmission
**Before:** Payment in `X-PAYMENT` HTTP header  
**After:** Payment in `params._meta["x402/payment"]`

### Settlement Response
**Before:** Settlement in `X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE` HTTP header  
**After:** Settlement in `result._meta["x402/payment-response"]`

## Benefits

- ✅ Follows official x402 MCP specification
- ✅ Transport-agnostic (works with any MCP transport, not just HTTP)
- ✅ Better integration with MCP protocol
- ✅ Cleaner architecture (payment handling at protocol layer, not transport layer)
- ✅ No breaking changes to public API

## Testing

All tests pass:
```
go test ./... -v
```

Result: 36/36 tests passing ✅

## Next Steps

The refactoring is complete and ready for:
1. Documentation updates (README.md, MIGRATION.md)
2. Example updates if needed
3. Integration testing with real facilitator
4. Merge to main branch
